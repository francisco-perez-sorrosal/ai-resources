# Artificial General Inteligence (AGI)

This has been, is, and will be for some more time at least, the dream of scientist/researchers/engineers in the field of artificial intelligence.

In short, achieving a general artificial intelligence assumes the ability of an agent to learn new tasks whilst maintaining a general capability on fulfilling previous learned tasks.

This artificial general intelligence requires that the agent does not forget what it has learn -what is called [catastrophic forgetting](#catastrophic_forgetting)

in the literature- and assumes that the agent will continue learning new tasks -called [continual or lifelong learning](#continual-learning).

Since the advent of ChatGPT on November 30th of 2022, there's been a lot of hype about this.
