## Translation

Along 2016/2017 Google switched from sentence-based/linguistic expert-based algorithmic approach to deep-learning based 
methods (what is called Neural Machine Translation, or NMT.) The leap in quality of the transations was massive:

- [Found in translation: More accurate, fluent sentences in Google Translate (Barak Turovsky, Google Translate Product Lead, Nov 2016](https://blog.google/products/translate/found-translation-more-accurate-fluent-sentences-google-translate/)
- [Higher quality neural translations for a bunch more languages (Barak Turovsky, Google Translate Product Lead, Mar 2017)](https://www.blog.google/products/translate/higher-quality-neural-translations-bunch-more-languages/)
- [A Neural Network for Machine Translation, at Production Scale](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/09/a-neural-network-for-machine.html)
- [The Shallowness of Google Translate (Douglas Hofstadter)](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-shallowness-of-google-translate/551570/)
