# Fei-Fei Li

# Marvin Minsky

Winner of the [Turing Award](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/minsky_7440781.cfm) in 1969. Joint with (#Seymour_Papert)
both being authors of "Perceptrons" {{ cite minsky_perceptrons_1987 }}, demonstrated initially that NN had severe learning limitations as a ML technique.
This is often cited as a cause for the advent of the first machine learning winter int the 70s.

Apart from this, he was famous from his "Theory of Frames", summarized in the paper, “A Framework for Representing Knowledge” {{ #cite minsky_framework_1974 }}.
The theory of frames is one of the things I still remember being introduced to during the poorly AI class I took at the
university (although I have to say that at that time, AI wasn't very popular due to all the buzz about the Internet and
the WWW flying around). This evolved years later in his broader theory for memory published in 1979 in the book 
“K-lines: A Theory of Memory” {{ #cite minsky_k-lines_1979 }}.

Known for being one of the persons developing [Backpropagation](vocabulary.md#backpropagation).
He was diagnosed with FTD (frontotemporal dementia). In FTD, some areas of the frontal lobes of the brain suffer an 
atrophy (they shrink), which in the end may cause problems with behavior and language depending on the area affected.

# Stephen Wolfram

Pioneer in Complexity theory and creator of Mathematica and Wolfgram Alpha mathematical search engine. He studied complexity
through cellular automatas (e.g. Conway's Game of Life.) John von Neuman also studied cellullar automata, in this case
for self-replication. [He found an automata](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/157/3785/180.1) with 29 states 
and a large memory that was able to self-replicate.
