# [Yoshua Bengio](yoshuabengio.org)

Joint with [Geoffrey Hinton](#geoffrey-hinton) and [Yann LeCunn](#yann-lecunn), he received the Turing Award in 2018. In
 the last decades, he's been one of the leading experts pushing the limits of field of AI contributing forward.

A computer scientist by career, he is a professor at Université de Montréal. [Ian Goodfellow](#ian-goofellow) was one
 of his students. He's also the Scientific Director of [Mila](books_and_resources.md#research-centerscommunities) in Quebec.

# Marvin Minsky

Winner of the [Turing Award](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/minsky_7440781.cfm) in 1969. Joint with (#Seymour_Papert)
both being authors of "Perceptrons" {{ cite minsky_perceptrons_1987 }}, demonstrated initially that NN had severe learning limitations as a ML technique.
This is often cited as a cause for the advent of the first machine learning winter int the 70s.

Apart from this, he was famous from his "Theory of Frames", summarized in the paper, “A Framework for Representing Knowledge” {{ #cite minsky_framework_1974 }}.
The theory of frames is one of the things I still remember being introduced to during the poorly AI class I took at the
university (although I have to say that at that time, AI wasn't very popular due to all the buzz about the Internet and
the WWW flying around). This evolved years later in his broader theory for memory published in 1979 in the book 
“K-lines: A Theory of Memory” {{ #cite minsky_k-lines_1979 }}.

In the 2006 AI@50 conference, he critized the AI community in not being focused on trying to solve the "general intelligence"
problem and be just focused on applications. According to T. Sejnosky, Dr. Minsky recognized in that conference to have
been the "devil" that caused the 1st winter period in AI in the 70s {{ #cite sejnowski_deep_2018 }}.

# Gary Marcus

Cognitive scientist (in his PhD had Steven Pinker as advisor,) founder of Geometric Intelligence, a ML company
 acquired by Uber in 2016. He's trying to "shape" the next steps in ML through his essays and articles (e.g. {{ cite marcus_next_2020 }}).
Well known for challenging the traditional [connectionist theories](approaches.md#connectionist), he believes that
 [neurons can be put together to build circuits in order to do things such as process rules or process structured 
 representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Marcus), which is more aligned with the Neuro-Symbolic Learning 
 and Reasoning line of work.

# Stephen Wolfram

Pioneer in Complexity theory and creator of Mathematica and Wolfgram Alpha mathematical search engine. He studied complexity
through cellular automatas (e.g. Conway's Game of Life.) John von Neuman also studied cellullar automata, in this case
for self-replication. [He found an automata](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/157/3785/180.1) with 29 states 
and a large memory that was able to self-replicate.
