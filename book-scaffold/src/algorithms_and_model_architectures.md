# Algorithms and Model Architectures

## Classical models

These models work with [features extracted](vocabulary.md#feature-engineering) from the data available. However, because
of this, these models can't take full advantage of large amounts of training data.

### Naive Bayes

### Support Vector Machines

SVMs

### Hidden Markov Models

HMMs

### Gradient Boosting Trees

GBTs

### Random Forests

## Neural Network Approaches

These neural network based algorithms to try to overcome the limitations of feature engineering over the data.
For example in NLP, these algorithms try to map input text to a low-dimensional continuous vector, which during
 training, captures the patterns that conform the distinct "features" or patterns hidden in that input text.
