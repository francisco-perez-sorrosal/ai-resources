# Overview

At the beginning of 2021, it's been some years by now that we are immersed in the world of data, the Big Data. In the last few years, [we've 
generated and collected more data than in all the previous history of mankind](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/?sh=4a82404a60ba).
This fact, joint with the recent improvements in computing power in the last decades, and the advances in a wide 
diversity of fields related to cognitive sciences have propelled Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to a new
status of preponderance in the modern world. Modern ML has already impacted our lives, and the impact will be higher in the
forthcoming years.

I love AI/ML because is a very complex topic which has to be approached with a multi-disciplinary view. It's a compendium 
of the advances and applications of well proven knowledge and battle-tested technology in many other fields, including:

- Cybernetics
- Mathematics & Statistics
- Neuroscience
- Computer Science
- Philosophy
- Cognitive Sciences
- Psychology
- Medicine
- Biology
- Physics
- Economics
- Algorithmic Biology

However, as it is true with most of the things in life, and despite the current advances and breakthroughs in the field, 
nothing is set in stone; we are and we'll continue being forever human & machine learners. As Newton stated in 1675, 
"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants." The only thing that is potentially different 
today from that Newton's assertion back in those days is that from now on, maybe the Giants won't be only other humans; 
maybe they'll be also artificially created machines, algorithms or models.

A few years ago, I found in Jorge Luis Borges' Funes the Memorious, what I thought it was a beautiful unconscious 
portrait in the form of words that I think summarizes quite well the current State of the Art of Artificial Intelligence/Machine 
Learning at the begining of the XXI century:

```text
"Había aprendido sin esfuerzo el inglés, el francés, el portugués, 
el latín. Sospecho, sin embargo, que no era muy capaz de pensar. 
Pensar es olvidar diferencias, es generalizar, es abstraer. En 
el abarrotado mundo de Funes no había sino detalles, casi inmediatos."

Funes el Memorioso (1944) - Jorge Luís Borges
```

```text
"With no effort, he had learned English, French, Portuguese and
Latin. I suspect, however, that he was not very capable of thought.
To think is to forget differences, generalize, make abstractions. In
the teeming world of Funes, there were only details, almost
immediate in their presence."

Funes the Memorious (1944) - Jorge Luís Borges
```

There are interesting times ahead of us. This field, joint with the advances in another promising multidisciplinary
scientific field, [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) and the possible fast development of
quantum computing in the next few years, guarantee endless fun for scientist and engineers in the next decades. This 
book pretends to be my modest log and diary on the topics depicted above and others that will arise along the way.
