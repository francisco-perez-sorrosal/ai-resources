Research Council at that period (cold ward) 

- 1969
  - Original publication of Perceptrons by S. Papert and M. Minsky {{ cite }}. This book is marked by some
experts (e.g. T. Sejnowsky {{ cite sejnowski_deep_2018 }}) as one of the causes to the dawn of the connectionist paradigm in the field of AI.
